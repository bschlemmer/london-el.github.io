          Instructions on what you need to be able to present remotely
          at the meetup.
	</p>

	<h2>Connection</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>We can first try Hangouts</li>
	  <li>Then Skype</li>
	  <li>Then <a href="https://appear.in/">appear.in</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  It would be good to have all of the above ready so that if
	  one approach fails, we can fail over to the next.
	</p>

	<h2>How long can I speak for?</h2>
	<p>
          Tell us how long do you need. Usually we have the venue for
          90-ish minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It's more important to deliver your message, rather than
	  sticking to some rigid format. But most of all, it needs to
	  be fun for you too.
