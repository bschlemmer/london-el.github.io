	<p>
          Instructions on what you need to be able to present remotely
          at the meetup.
	</p>

	<h2>Connection</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>We can first try Hangouts</li>
	  <li>Then Skype</li>
	  <li>Then <a href="https://appear.in/">appear.in</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  It would be good to have all of the above ready so that if
	  one approach fails, we can fail over to the next.
	</p>

	<h2>How long can I speak for?</h2>
	<p>
          Tell us how long do you need. Usually we have the venue for
          90-ish minutes, with typically 2-3 speakers. If you know the
          duration of your talk, then it can be planned around it.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It's more important to deliver your message, rather than
	  sticking to some rigid format. But most of all, it needs to
	  be fun for you too.
	</p>

	<h2>Background colours</h2>
	<p>
	  Please consider the fact that the background of your
	  presentation notes and/or Emacs might not be legible with the
	  default that you have for yourself.
	</p>

	<h2>Hide pop ups</h2>
	<p>
	  Usually the screen sharing software has some sort of message
	  telling you that your screen is being shared. Try to get rid
	  of it so that when your screen is recorded it looks clean
	  and free of distractions.
